Version A of our game: https://h-brs.sciebo.de/s/k6XQHNCUeJPCf1n
Version B of our game: https://h-brs.sciebo.de/s/LkBeBB4sqfK6cqn
The differences between those two versions is described in our GDD.



The structure of this repository is as follows:

Evaluation folder:
This folder contains the Python script that was written for the evaluation and the measured game metrics file. It also contains the data from the survey (final_main_data.csv) and the filtered data (result.csv), which were used by the script for the analysis.

My project folder:
This folder contains our Unity project including all assets, scripts, objects, images, etc. used.
