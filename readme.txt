Version A of our game: https://h-brs.sciebo.de/s/k6XQHNCUeJPCf1n
Version B of our game: https://h-brs.sciebo.de/s/LkBeBB4sqfK6cqn
The differences between those two versions is described in our final GDD.


The structure of this repository is as follows:

Evaluation folder:
This folder contains the Python script (Script.ipynb) that was written for the evaluation and the measured game metrics file (GameMetrics.ods). It also contains the data from the survey (final_main_data.csv) and the filtered data (result.csv), which were used by the script for the analysis.
The Evaluation folder also includes the figures folder, which contains all diagram images.

My project folder:
This folder contains our Unity project including all assets, scripts, objects, images, etc. used.

GDD.pdf:
Our GDD at the time of the beta version.

Final_Developer_Diary.pdf:
Our GDD at the time of the final submission.

TheLostSenses_Presentation.pdf:
Our presentation file. For slide 2 (Idea) and 3 (Conception), videos are shown in our presentation video, which is why there is no slide design there. It should also be noted that the playthrough video is played after slide 9 (Beta - Features) before slide 10 (Evaluation) is shown.
